# CA Avengers Interview Tasks

This is a repo with minimal React project.
After cloning the repo, make sure to run 'npm install' to install all the depencendies and run npm start to run your project
Now you can start with the tasks

Task 1:
- In components folder, there is a component named Header, that is already being displaed on the main page. Your task is to change Header's background color from chocolate to darkred (#8b0000)

Task 2:
- Using the same way, create another component named "Body", give it any apropriate hight and full width. Set background color to your prefereble color.
- Set its top margin to 100px
- Display newly created component "Body" below the "Header" on the same page.

Task 3:
- Now we are going to use Ant Design module for our UI components (refer to [this](https://ant.design/components/overview/) page for help)
- Add a button (anywhere on "Body" component, style it anyway you like) with the title "ON"
- Now add a property to the button OnClick that will change the title from "ON" to "OFF" and back to "ON" on every click
- Now, assuming that your "Body" background color is light colored, on every button click, the background color should change to black (simulating ligts are off), and back you your previous color (lights on)
